    <!-- OLD BIO
      Mick has been dealing with tech of all kinds his whole life and has
    developed a knack for being able to quickly create custom technical
    solutions for all kinds of problems. He has accumulated a rather extensive
    list of skills over the years trying to find the right match for him before
    he settled into the technical industry after having his first child. Largely
    self-taught, he has a unique way of approaching problems that provides a
    fresh insight into things that others may overlook. Mick is married with 2
    children.
    -->
    Mick has extensive experience in many fields of tech, and has been deeply
    ingrained in it for the majority of his life. He has an exceptional ability
    to tackle problems with a unique approach due to his largely self-taught
    knowledgebase. His motto is "If it has buttons, switches or wires, I can
    probably fix it" and has rarely come across a problem he cannot solve given
    a little time. Mick is married with two children.
